# Report - analysis of limitations and weaknesses

## George
- Found an issue through running github copilot in the app.js file
- Issue: The bot's suit-check compared the user's guessed suit (which is normalized to lowercase) against the secret card's suit value without normalizing case, so players who actually guessed the suit would be told they were wrong if casing was different. 
- Made the small fix to make sure a correct guess wouldnt be seen as wrong by the code.
